                            <p>From being entitled as 'elixir of life' to 'jar of health', ghee's spiritual value, besides its medicinal and culinary importance, is undeniable. Our ancient scriptures and Vedas throw light on ghee's significance by describing it as a (flawless) Nirdosh food, which increases body vigour and vitality. According to Atharva Veda, ghee's use strengthens the body and enhances life span. Vedas call ghee 'the first and most essential of all foods'.</p>
